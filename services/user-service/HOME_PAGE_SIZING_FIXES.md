# Home Page Sizing Fixes

## Issue
The home page was displaying extra large icons and images, making the layout appear disproportionate.

## Changes Made

### 1. Feature Card Icons
- Changed icon size from `icon-xl` to `icon-lg` (2.5rem → 2rem)
- Reduced SVG dimensions from `w-8 h-8` to `w-5 h-5`
- Adjusted padding from `p-3` to `p-2`
- Reduced margin from `mr-6` to `mr-4`

**Affected sections:**
- Secure Authentication icon
- Multi-Language Support icon
- Modern UI/UX icon
- API Ready icon

### 2. Hero Section
- Reduced main title from `text-6xl` to `text-4xl`
- Changed subtitle sizes:
  - "Welcome to" from `text-2xl` to `text-lg`
  - Tagline from `text-xl` to `text-lg`
- Reduced description text from `text-xl` to `text-lg`
- Changed max width from `max-w-3xl` to `max-w-2xl`
- Reduced vertical padding from `py-24` to `py-16`

### 3. Floating Background Elements
- Reduced sizes to create better visual hierarchy:
  - Large element: `w-40 h-40` → `w-24 h-24`
  - Medium element: `w-24 h-24` → `w-16 h-16`
  - Small elements: `w-20 h-20` → `w-14 h-14`
  - Tiny element: `w-16 h-16` → `w-12 h-12`

## Result
The home page now has properly proportioned elements that create a more balanced and professional appearance. The icons are appropriately sized relative to their content, and the hero section no longer dominates the viewport with oversized text.

## Testing Recommendations
1. View the page at different screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior
2. Check that all interactive elements remain easily clickable
3. Verify text readability at the new sizes
4. Test on both desktop and mobile devices
