## 🔧 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Frontend Container Port Binding Issue ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Frontend container was mapped to `3005:3005` but React runs on port 3000
- Container was not binding to `0.0.0.0` properly
- React development server was not accessible from outside the container

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Updated docker-compose.yml:**
   ```yaml
   ports:
     - "3005:3000"  # Map host 3005 to container 3000
   environment:
     REACT_APP_API_URL: http://localhost:3000
     REACT_APP_ENV: development
     PORT: 3000
     WDS_SOCKET_HOST: localhost
     WDS_SOCKET_PORT: 3005
   command: sh -c "npm start -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000"
   ```

2. **Updated Dockerfile:**
   ```dockerfile
   EXPOSE 3000
   CMD ["sh", "-c", "npm start -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000"]
   ```

3. **Rebuilt and restarted container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build frontend
   ```

**Result:** ✅ Frontend is now accessible at `http://localhost:3005`
